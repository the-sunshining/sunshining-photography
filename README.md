# SunShining-Photography
An Open Source Photo Library

# Why?
I love spring photography.
I love summer photography.
I love fall photography.
I love winter photography.
I love nature photography.
I love croc photography.
I love cemetery photography.
Most of all I love SunShining Photography.
(Photo of sunsets, sunrises, and just photos that shine.)
Hey, why not name this SunShining Photography.
Thats a good idea. I think I will.

# History
I origionaly started sunshining photography as a website to share photography in 2015 with and easy drag and drop website designer called weebly.
Since then I have joined the open source community. 
(Thats kind of a long story made short -  if there is one thing you need to know it is that my photography website got me into doing what I am doing today! - even if what I am doing today looks different than what it looked like 5 years ago.)

And over the years I have stoped sharing photography on my photography website because developing and coding has kept me busy.
But through the years I have still enjoyed taking photos. And the desire to share them has never changed. So one day (first day of fall 2020) I get the idea to continue the legacy of SunShining Photography by creating and open source photo library.

# Note
This being a one man project it may take me a while to actually grow this photo library.
But I welcome contributions.  
I want to make a photo website, extention, or app to share these photos.
